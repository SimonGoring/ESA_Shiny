##Introduction

##Methods


We used a web scraper written in R [@RBase] to read messages from ECOLOG from the years 2000 - 2015. This program pulled the message, message date and message subject for each ECOLOG posting.  Messages from ECOLOG were then transformed into a matrix using text analysis tools in the `tm` package for R [@tmcitation].

Once the matrix was generated we classified a number of records by hand using a Shiny application.  Messages were identified as job ads, classified into graduate, postdoctoral, and tenure track positions, and then also classified as interdisciplinary or not.  Based on the surveyed messages we built a model using a random forest to classify messages as tenure track jobs, postdoctoral positions and graduate positions, and to test whether messages indicate interdisciplinarity.  Based on the model constructed using the BRT we then predict the class of the remaining messages to build a time series of job ads

##Results

Once we pull the messages from ECOLOG we find that we obtain `r nrow(dtm.s99) - sum(rowSums(dtm.s99) == 0)` messages.  We clean the text in these messages to remove punctuation, extra whitespace, HTML tags, stop words and numbers using the `tm_map` function from the `tm` package [@REF].  This leaves us with a set of `r ncol(dtm.s99)` terms.

The frequency of terms in the ECOLOG corpus follows a log distribution.  The most frequent terms (will, n=82355; research, n=61951; university, n=38996; field, n=35004; ecology, n=33768) have much higher frequencies than the mean (u_terms_ = 2615).

When we look at the key terms that identify tenure track jobs it seems fairly straightforward: "Teaching", "tenuretrack", "professor", "assistant", "department", "position", "applications", "undergraduate", "faculty" and "successful".  Interestingly, there's lots of cross-over with positions that are interdisciplinary in general. The key term in this case is "interdisciplinary".  We're really looking at interdisciplinary jobs here, so it's no surprise that terms like "position", "project", "applications" show up, but the importance rank of "postdoctoral" (rank = 5) and "phd" (rank = 6) is much higher than the importance of "tenuretrack" (rank = 215) or "professor" (rank = 215), indicating a much higher incidence of interdisciplinary advertisments for graduate and postdoctoral positions than for professors.
