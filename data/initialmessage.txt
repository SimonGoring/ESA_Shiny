Thank you for helping us to analyse the job posting history of ECOLOG-L.

This research project relies on you to categorize a set of messages (as many or as few as you'd like).  After you hit the "Confirm" button you'll begin to see messages from ECOLOG.  Do your best (but don't kill yourself!) to identify key characteristics of the messages.  In particular we want to know a bit about who the job is for, how much it pays, and what kind of qualifications are neccessary.  Most critically we want to know whether or not the job identifies interdisciplinarity as a key component of the ad.  To help identify this aspect we've <b>bolded</b> and <u>underlined</u> the terms inter-, multi- and trans-disciplinary.

If the post isn't an ad please check <u>'Not an Ad'</u>, and if there's something you're not sure about, please check <u>'Something I'm not Sure Of'</u>.

We really appreciate your help.  If you have any questions, please contact Simon Goring at <a href=mailto:goring@wisc.edu>goring@wisc.edu</a>, or on twitter at <a href=http://twitter.com/sjgoring>@sjgoring</a>.
